#### Problem

- Your task is to write a function that takes two parameters: the year of birth and the year to count years in relation to.
  - 출생연도부터 해당연도까지 계산하는 함수를 작성해라.

<br>

#### Solution 01

```js
function calculateAge(birthYear, currentYear) {
   let year = Math.abs(birthYear - currentYear) === 1 ? 'year' : 'years';
   
   if (birthYear === currentYear) return `You were born this very year!`;
   if (birthYear < currentYear) return `You are ${currentYear - birthYear} ${year} old.`;
   if (birthYear > currentYear) return `You will be born in ${-currentYear + birthYear} ${year}.`;
}

calculateAge(1988, 1988);	// You were born this very year!
calculateAge(1988, 1989);	// You are 1 year old.
calculateAge(1988, 2019);	// You are 31 years old.
calculateAge(1988, 1987);	// You will be born in 1 year.
calculateAge(2030, 2019);	// You will be born in 11 years.
```

<br>

#### Solution 02

```js
function calculateAge(birthYear, currentYear) {
   let age = currentYear - birthYear;
   
   if (age === 1) return `You are 1 year old.`;
   else if (age === -1) return `You will be born in 1 year.`;
   else if (age > 0) return `You are ${age} years old.`;
   else if (age < 0) return `You will be born in ${-age} years.`;
   else return `You were born this very year!`;
}

calculateAge(1988, 1988);	// You were born this very year!
calculateAge(1988, 1989);	// You are 1 year old.
calculateAge(1988, 2019);	// You are 31 years old.
calculateAge(1988, 1987);	// You will be born in 1 year.
calculateAge(2030, 2019);	// You will be born in 11 years.
```
