#### Problem

- Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn.
  - 꽃잎을 찢을 때마다 다음 문구를 말한다.

<br>

1. I love you
2. a little
3. a lot
4. passionately
5. madly
6. not at all

<br>

- Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say for a flower of a given number of petals.
  - 꽃잎 수가 주어지면, 해당 꽃잎의 문구를 결정해라.

<br>

#### Solution 01

```js
function howMuchILoveYou(nPetals) {
   const phrase = [
      'I love you',
      'a little',
      'a lot',
      'passionately',
      'madly',
      'not at all'
   ];
   
   return phrase[(nPetals - 1) % phrase.length];
}

howMuchILoveYou(1);	// I love you
howMuchILoveYou(2);	// a little
howMuchILoveYou(3);	// a lot
howMuchILoveYou(4);	// passionately
howMuchILoveYou(5);	// madly
howMuchILoveYou(6);	// not at all
howMuchILoveYou(7);	// I love you

function howMuchILoveYou(nPetals) {
   const phrase = {
      0: 'not at all',

      3: 'a lot',
      4: 'passionately',
      5: 'madly'
   };
   
   return phrase[nPetals % 6];
}

howMuchILoveYou(1);	// I love you
howMuchILoveYou(2);	// a little
howMuchILoveYou(3);	// a lot
howMuchILoveYou(4);	// passionately
howMuchILoveYou(5);	// madly
howMuchILoveYou(6);	// not at all
